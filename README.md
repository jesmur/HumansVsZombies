# HumansVsZombies

## Life simulator written in C++.

Humans and zombies are randomized on a map. 

Zombies consume humans but may not breed.

Humans do not consume zombies, yet may breed after a set number of turns.

If a zombie does not consume a human after a set number of turns, it dies.

The program is terminated if an extinction event of either creature occurs.
